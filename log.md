# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Using Event Emitter data is sent to one service from another service. Now from Recipe details page user can send ingredients to shopping list. Added Logic to increment the amount of existing ingredients. I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/_siva_sankar/status/1321876840374431745?s=20) publicly that I commit myself to code for atleast one hout daily for 100 days

**Thoughts:**  Today discussed with my friend about designing services(RecipeManager & ShoppingManager). His opinion is asking ShoppingManager to add ingredients should be a concern of RecipeDetail component. it should not be convern of RecipeManager Service. It seems to be correct for me

### Day 1: Octobber 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Routing in Angular from [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/). Removed events and properties used to hide and show components and added Routing logic using Routingmodule of Angular

**Thoughts:** To be honest laziness came up on the first day itself. Distracted to do an Interview assignment then distracted to youtube videos like obama visiting bookstore, icecream parlor, movie clips, vlogs, news/educative documentaries, shows untill 10:45pm. Then I hit the course and play it in 2x finally done this change in few seconds and commited/pushed it.

### Day 2: Octobber 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
* Learned RouterLink property to map routes registered in app module with components. 
* And learned ActivatedRoute object to navigate to routes programmatically. 
* Learned Differences of relative path from components typescript's code and from routerLink property of acnchor html element <a>
* Learned to pass route parameters/Query parameters/fragments and fetch parameters/Query parameters/fragments using snapshot obj and Route Observables like this.ActivatedRoute.params
* Learned Nested Child routes.
  
**Thoughts:** Today starting from morning 11.00am to midnight 12.00AM I sat for learning [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/). Implemented parellely on a project what i am learning. at last for the challenge I dedicated last one hour of the day and added nested child routing. I have completed substantial part of course(Routing section gonna finish). Spent time for this was very large. wanna more efficient. wanna code for production ready projects like porting chrome extensions to firefox

### Day 3: November 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I am working on an console application simulating energy monitor system. First time wrote unit tests. Felt the habit of unit testing is picking up for me. Technology used are dotnet core, nunit, Vs Code

**Thoughts:**  Got more focus today. I've used time quite efficiently comparatively. Need to work on more focus, more efficient use of time

**Link to work:** maintaining local repo. After asignment is assed, I wil push it

### Day 4: November 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Came up with algorithm to decide which AC to switch on and off when Light is switching off and on respectively. Implemented that. Trying to separate that logic into separate object so that new rules can be used without much change in the code. Unit tests for Floor which test the above algorithm ran successfully.

**Thoughts:** Frustrated to think up on the algorithm/rules. Took long break and completed. Need to do same type of exercises to do it more efficiently.

### Day 5: November 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Yesterday was cheat day. I bbecame lazy and lose fire once got comfortable with new job and also got less time to work since baby sitter haven't show up.    minor bug fixed in process Sensor Input string method. With run time error, unit test cases added for Building class. most of the time worked in Unit test cases
* 51 mins 	...Tests/BuildingTest.cs
* 19 mins 	...Building.cs
* 13 mins 	.vscode/launch.json
* 10 mins 	ElectricityController/Floor.cs
* 6 mins 	...NaturalLanguageInputProcess.cs
* 3 mins 	...Program.cs
* 2 mins 	...Tests/SmartControllerTest.cs
* 1 min 	README.md
* 1 min 	...Tests/SubCorridorTest.cs
* 1 min 	...SmartController.cs

**Thoughts:** Need to do more code. Need to spend more time. It is not enough

### Day 6: November 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today mostly worked on processing input from console to accomodate redirected input from file. And made light property of corridor object private . The idea is if these implementation details are encapsulated, in future it is easy to extend like if more number of lights added per corridor

**Thoughts:** Same as yesterday. Need to speed up.
