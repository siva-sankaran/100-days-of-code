# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Using Event Emitter data is sent to one service from another service. Now from Recipe details page user can send ingredients to shopping list. Added Logic to increment the amount of existing ingredients. I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/_siva_sankar/status/1321876840374431745?s=20) publicly that I commit myself to code for atleast one hout daily for 100 days

**Thoughts:**  Today discussed with my friend about designing services(RecipeManager & ShoppingManager). His opinion is asking ShoppingManager to add ingredients should be a concern of RecipeDetail component. it should not be convern of RecipeManager Service. It seems to be correct for me
