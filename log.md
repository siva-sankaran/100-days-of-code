# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Using Event Emitter data is sent to one service from another service. Now from Recipe details page user can send ingredients to shopping list. Added Logic to increment the amount of existing ingredients. I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/_siva_sankar/status/1321876840374431745?s=20) publicly that I commit myself to code for atleast one hout daily for 100 days

**Thoughts:**  Today discussed with my friend about designing services(RecipeManager & ShoppingManager). His opinion is asking ShoppingManager to add ingredients should be a concern of RecipeDetail component. it should not be convern of RecipeManager Service. It seems to be correct for me

### Day 1: Octobber 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Routing in Angular from [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/). Removed events and properties used to hide and show components and added Routing logic using Routingmodule of Angular

**Thoughts:** To be honest laziness came up on the first day itself. Distracted to do an Interview assignment then distracted to youtube videos like obama visiting bookstore, icecream parlor, movie clips, vlogs, news/educative documentaries, shows untill 10:45pm. Then I hit the course and play it in 2x finally done this change in few seconds and commited/pushed it.

**Thoughts:** Today starting from morning 11.00am to midnight 12.00AM I sat for learning [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/). Implemented parellely on a project what i am learning. at last for the challenge I dedicated last one hour of the day and added nested child routing. I have completed substantial part of course(Routing section gonna finish). Spent time for this was very large. wanna more efficient. wanna code for production ready projects like porting chrome extensions to firefox
